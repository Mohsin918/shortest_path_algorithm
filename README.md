Dijkstra's Shortest Path Visualization

Introduction
Welcome to Dijkstra's Shortest Path Visualization project! This project aims to provide a visual representation of Dijkstra's algorithm, a popular graph traversal algorithm used to find the shortest path between two given nodes.

Dijkstra's algorithm, named after computer scientist Edsger W. Dijkstra, is widely used in various applications such as network routing protocols, map navigation, and transportation systems. It guarantees the shortest path from a source node to all other nodes in the graph.

Getting Started
To run this project locally, please ensure that you have Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your computer. If you don't have them, you can download and install Node.js from the official website: https://nodejs.org/

Installation
After cloning or downloading this repository, navigate to the project directory and install all the required dependencies by running the following command:
npm install
npm start

This will launch the project and open it in your default web browser at http://localhost:3000/. You should see Dijkstra's Shortest Path Visualization application up and running.
